== Description ==

This plugin will give you the ability to add your Facebook Page Message to your client's websites. This chat will only be visible to  Admin users. The idea of this plugin is to give support to your clients once the website is delivered and running. Your client will be able to contact you directly from their website regarding any issue they might have been experimenting, this way you can have a more long-lasting relationship with past clients, or give them support in the case you have a maintenance plan with them.
